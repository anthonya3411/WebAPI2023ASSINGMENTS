    <p>The things picked above were chosen either because they're valued to me, or I enjoy them. Games like Minecraft and anything made by FromSoftware have been a huge
        part of gaming for me. Both Mojang and FromSoftware are extremely infulential to me in terms of game design and where inspiration is drawn. As goes for the rest,
        I picked programming because it's one of my favorite activities, and then Java because it's (currently) my favorite language. The food was picked because they're some of
        my favorite meals (and they're relatively inexpensive).
